# Getting Started

Welcome to **XDR Compliance Centre**.  
This dashboard combines vulnerability posture, device health, policy quality, and standards alignment in one workflow.

## Navigation

- **Overview**: executive KPIs, risk matrix, and high-priority exposure signals.
- **Devices**: managed asset inventory, health posture, and Defender version coverage.
- **Policies**: Conditional Access policy coverage, gap queue, overlap insights, and journey map.
- **Vulnerabilities**: threat relevance, patch prioritization, and remediation planning.
- **Standards**: CIS Controls, NIST CSF 2.0, identity baseline, and NIS2 readiness mapping.

## Filters and Scope

- Use top filter chips to scope the view by data window and severity.
- Cards and lists update to reflect filter context.
- Detail flyouts preserve the same filter context, so numbers remain consistent.

## Reading the Dashboard

- **Executive strip** gives a rapid posture snapshot.
- **Card-level views** explain the contributing signals behind each metric.
- **Detail flyouts** show evidence, affected entities, and recommended next steps.

## Working Pattern

1. Start in **Overview** to identify priority pressure points.
2. Move to **Vulnerabilities** and **Devices** for root-cause detail.
3. Use **Policies** to remove control gaps and policy sprawl.
4. Validate improvements in **Standards** view and executive cards.

## Data Modes

- `MOCK DATA`: local sample model for design/testing.
- `LIVE DATA`: Graph/Defender datasets loaded successfully.
- `PARTIAL LIVE`: at least one data source loaded, others failed.
- `SESSION EXPIRED`: token refresh or interactive sign-in required.

## Keyboard

- Press `Esc` to close open flyouts/panels quickly.
